# HTML Resources.

This project is a portfolio of some different HTML, CSS, and JavaScript resources that I've worked on over the years. No fancy tech stacks, just back to the basics and proof of concepts.
## Projects

- Dynamic Information Cards [HTML, CSS, JS, JSON].
## Running

Certain resources within this project may utilize PHP or require JSON, necessitating the use of a local HTTP server to properly view and edit them. Setting up a local server can be accomplished easily using Python. To do so with python, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
```

This command will initiate a local HTTP server on port 8000, allowing you to access and interact with the resources as needed.
